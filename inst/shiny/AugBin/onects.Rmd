Let $Y_{i1}$ represent the observed continuous outcome for patient $i \in N$ and $\mathbf{Y}=(\mathbf{Y_{1}},\ldots \mathbf{Y_{N}})^{T}$ represent the observed outcomes for all patients.  $T_{i}$ represents the treatment indicator for patient i and $y_{i10}$ is the baseline measure for $Y_{i1}$. 

The mean structure for the outcome is shown below, where the baseline measures $y_{10}$ is included in the model for $Y_{i1}$. 

$$\begin{equation}
Y_{i1}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}T_{i}+\alpha_{2}y_{i10}+\varepsilon_{i1}
\end{equation}$$

We can model the error term as normal with zero mean and variance $\sigma^{2}$. The likelihood contribution for patient i is as shown below

$$\begin{equation}
l\left(\boldsymbol{\theta};Y_{i1}\right)=f(Y_{i1};\boldsymbol{\theta})
\end{equation}$$
